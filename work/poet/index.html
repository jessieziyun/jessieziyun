                Poet is a consideration of a society built on alternative power structures and the artefacts that exist within it. An imagined product of this future where nature and technology coexist harmoniously and without hierarchy, it allows users to communicate with a plant through poetry. This plant poet is not an object that is owned, but a cohabiter in a larger-than human world. If the plant is happy– if it has been cared for and interacted with– it will respond to touch by generating a poem.
