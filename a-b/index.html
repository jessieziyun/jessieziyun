To explore this issue, I created Advertising Bot, a speculative artificial intelligence system that generates targeted advertisements in real time influenced by viewer emotional response among other data points. To demonstrate its capabilities, I used it to advertise a smart eye implant to two different viewers. As we generate and give up more and more data, and create more and more powerful technologies, how will we regulate their use, and who gets to decide what is ethical?" />
